# ical4android

ical4android is a library for Android that brings together iCalendar and Android.
It's a framework for

* parsing and generating iCalendar resources (using [ical4j](https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j))
  from/into data classes that are compatible with the Android Calendar Provider and
  third-party task providers,
* accessing the Android Calendar Provider (and third-party task providers) over a unified API.

It has been primarily developed for:

* [DAVx⁵](https://www.davx5.com)
* [ICSx⁵](https://icsx5.bitfire.at)

and is currently used as git submodule.
